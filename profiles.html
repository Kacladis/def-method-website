      <p>Born in Northeast of Brazil in 1975. I am the third of my four siblings to have become a Software Engineer. Iâ€™ve
        been working as a Software Engineer since 2000 in the insurance, financial back office, cellular, drilling, and
        digital security industries. A couple of years ago, I moved to NYC to continue my journey as a Software Engineer
        and joined the Def Method team in 2017. I have three passions: programming, music, and skateboarding. These days I
        use my skateboard to commute to work, let music be my daily inspiration, and let programming be what feeds my
        intellect. That way I can have each of my passions present in my everyday life.</p>

        working again. I was so proud of myself! I think that's when I fell in love with computers.</p>
      <p>I got into programming in high school, when I started writing simple programs on my TI-89 graphing calculator -
        like solving chemistry equations, that sort of thing. One day I decided I wanted to make a tic tac toe game. I
        really struggled with it, but a friend of mine helped me out and taught me a lot of things. In the end, we created
        a fully functional two-player game, though we never made an attempt at an AI. That entire process - struggling
