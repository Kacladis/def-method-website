<div id='joshua-developer'>
<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> "I transitioned from being a filmmaker. And for me, video games were a bridge. But I think I really knew I wanted to do something in tech when as I was searching hard in life for some solid direction I realized I wanted to make "tools" for people that would empower them. Then actually reading Steve Jobs bio had a big impact on me, that those tools could actually come from private companies that create products that are not only successful and profitable but life changing, empowering, and powerful."</p>
