<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be an entrepreneur? </strong>"When I was eight years old I started my first business called <em>Creative Jewls</em>. &nbsp;I would make animal shaped cufflinks out of Sculpey clay and sell them to my father's tailor for $20/pair who would then sell them to his clients for $40/pair. The fact that others were interested in what I had built fascinated and excited me."</p>
