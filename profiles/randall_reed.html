Randall is a Senior Software Engineer at Def Method, with nine years of software development experience and eight years of consulting experience. His background includes tax software consulting with government agencies and web development at a med-tech startup, working on teams ranging from 2 to over 30 developers. He is familiar with both Federal Tax Information (FTI) and HIPAA privacy protocols. He moved to New York to make the switch from Visual Basic .NET enterprise software development into web development. Adopting agile software development methodology has been a happy side effect of that transition.

 "When I was in kindergarten, we had a computer in our classroom that we could use to play educational games. One day the computer wasn't working - frozen or crashed or something. I had no idea what I was doing, but I messed with it for a few minutes and got it working again. I was so proud of myself! I think that's when I fell in love with computers.
