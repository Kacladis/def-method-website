<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> "I have always been interested in computers starting back in the day helping install Lotus Suits by feeding in 30 3.5" hard disks. Today it's the combination of practical logic against human psychology especially in modern applications that fascinates me."</p>
