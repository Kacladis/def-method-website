<p>Nichole grew up in Lowell, MA and attended college at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA. In 2011, she decided to spend some time abroad and ended up living in Cairo, Egypt for 3.5 years, then Stockholm, Sweden for another year. During this time, she worked for angel investors searching for tech start-ups in the Middle East in which to invest. Upon moving back to the US in 2016, she enrolled in Grace Hopper Academy and has been working as an engineer since October of that year.</p>

<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> My interest in software development was first piqued when I took an intro to CS class as my science requirement in college. After graduating, I found myself taking on various small tasks that involved some basic level of development, from creating html forms to creating custom workflow components on the Salesforce platform. After working for 4 years with tech start-ups on the investor side, my interest grew into a desire to change careers, so I decided to make the switch two years ago.</p>
