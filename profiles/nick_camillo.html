<p>Nick started his career at Microsoft as a traveling consultant doing enterprise solutions, then left after two years to start his own marketing/web development/video production consultancy. During that time he taught himself Ruby on Rails in order to build ALittleBitWeird.com, a music distribution platform that allowed fans to download free music in exchange for providing exposure on social media. Nick went on to build BidMessenger.com, a Bid Process Management solution that saves Construction Estimators 8+ hours on every bid by automating 99% of communications between Prime and Subcontractors. Eager to continue his education alongside other talented developers, he joined Def Method as a Software Engineer in August of 2017. In his free time, Nick is a singer-songwriter and also plays guitar in a math rock band.</p>

<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong></p><p>I never really made a conscious decision to work in tech, it's just that all the projects that I was interested in pursuing led me down the tech route. In high school I wanted a cool myspace, so I learned HTML/CSS. In college I wanted to run an eCommerce website/blog so I learned php/wordpress. After college I wanted to build a digital media distribution platform, so I learned Ruby on Rails. I'm motivated by my goals, and I learn whatever I need to along the way in order to accomplish them.</p>
