<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> "I think it was when I played the first Civilization game. It could have been earlier, video games were definitely the entry point, but Civ was one of the first that I can remember wanting to know how things worked under the hood. I also have a distinct memory of doing some "modding" to it, which was probably in truth changing some .ini files and uploading a crude picture from paint to make it so that you could build Start Destroyers in the game."</p>
