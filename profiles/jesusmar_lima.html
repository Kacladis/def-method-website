Born in Northeast of Brazil in 1975. I am the third of my four siblings to have become a Software Engineer. Iâ€™ve been working as a Software Engineer since 2000 in the insurance, financial back office, cellular, drilling, and digital security industries. A couple of years ago, I moved to NYC to continue my journey as a Software Engineer and joined the Def Method team in 2017. I have three passions: programming, music, and skateboarding. These days I use my skateboard to commute to work, let music be my daily inspiration, and let programming be what feeds my intellect. That way I can have each of my passions present in my everyday life.

 "My oldest brother is to blame. When I was a child he was a Software Engineer at Banco da Amazonia SA in Brazil and he took me to his office to spend the night running batches and programming. I thought to myself, "I want to do this."
