<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong></p><p>Remember Xanga? I had to learn html and web hosting practices just to upload and link a picture back in the early, early 2000's. Today's technology is whole 'nother beast, and I'm always curious to know what tomorrow's technology has in store. I'm not a developer myself, but I am dev-friendly and can communicate well with clients and tech teams.</p>
