Tom has worked in software since 2012, most of that time in the .NET ecosystem (initial Windows desktop applications). He has been doing full stack from front end to back end for a little over 2 years. He currently resides in Monmouth County, NJ and worked exclusively in NJ until joining Def Method, and he is learning to love NYC. Tom loves learning about new things.

<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> "In high school I was in an electronics class where we had to build a 'firefighting robot'. The robot had to navigate a small 'floorplan'&nbsp;made out of plywood, detect a candle, and activate a fan to blow the candle out. The teacher left us to attempt to learn how to program the robot on our own without guidance at initially. The first time I got the robot to simply turn left in response to an object being in front of it was the coolest feeling. I've been hooked on developing software ever since."</p>
