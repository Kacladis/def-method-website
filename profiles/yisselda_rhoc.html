I grew up in Paris, France. I have always enjoyed traveling, science and speaking other languages. I completed a Master degree in Artificial intelligence in 2013 and started working for as a consultant with Capgemini, a technology services company. After 2 years of building .NET apps, I moved to NY. I took this opportunity to check volunteering and living in the USA of my bucket list. I since then volunteer as a cat adoption counselor and do cooking demonstrations to promote eating veggies and fruits.

<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong></p><p>One summer, I was building a website for a musician as well as helping around in the recording studio. At that time, I was interested in becoming a sound engineer. I found getting the website up and running and coming up with the creative content so rewarding that I persevered in CS!</p>
