I grew up in Paris, France. I have always enjoyed traveling, science and speaking other languages. I completed a Master degree in Artificial intelligence in 2013 and started working for as a consultant with Capgemini, a technology services company. After 2 years of building .NET apps, I moved to NY. I took this opportunity to check volunteering and living in the USA of my bucket list. I since then volunteer as a cat adoption counselor and do cooking demonstrations to promote eating veggies and fruits.
