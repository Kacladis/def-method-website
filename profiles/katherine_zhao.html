<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be an entrepreneur? </strong></p><p>"I've always loved starting my own clubs and organizations at school whenever I felt like there was a space in the community that needed to be filled by one. There's something really exciting to me about adding value to different spaces and communities and people. In high school, I co-founded a community service organization focused on improving access to literacy and learning.&nbsp;At Princeton, I did a lot of social entrepreneurship. I worked with the faculty of the Arts Center to design and implement various initiatives and programs to improve accessibility to the arts."&nbsp;</p>
