<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in the tech space?</strong> I was at a Philly Tech week event about 3 years ago with a friend of mine and I remember telling her that I had never felt more at home at an industry conference then I did at that moment. &nbsp;It was exciting to be around so many passionate people who were legitimately enthusiastic about their careers and the future of their respective fields. It was at this moment that I decided that I needed to pivot towards tech at some point in my career.</p>
