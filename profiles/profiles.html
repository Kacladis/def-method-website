<p>Born in Northeast of Brazil in 1975. I am the third of my four siblings to have become a Software Engineer. I’ve been working as a Software Engineer since 2000 in the insurance, financial back office, cellular, drilling, and digital security industries. A couple of years ago, I moved to NYC to continue my journey as a Software Engineer and joined the Def Method team in 2017. I have three passions: programming, music, and skateboarding. These days I use my skateboard to commute to work, let music be my daily inspiration, and let programming be what feeds my intellect. That way I can have each of my passions present in my everyday life.</p>

In 2011, she decided to spend some time abroad and ended up living in Cairo, Egypt for 3.5 years, then Stockholm, Sweden for another year. During this time, she worked for angel investors searching for tech start-ups in the Middle East in which to invest. Upon moving back to the US in 2016, she enrolled in Grace Hopper Academy and has been working as an engineer since October of that year.</p>

<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> My interest in software development was first piqued when I took an intro to CS class as my science requirement in college. After graduating, I found myself taking on various small tasks that involved some basic level of development, from creating html forms to creating custom workflow components on the Salesforce platform. After working for 4 years with tech start-ups on the investor side, my interest grew into a desire to change careers, so I decided to make the switch two years ago.</p>

<p>Nick started his career at Microsoft as a traveling consultant doing enterprise solutions, then left after two years to start his own marketing/web development/video production consultancy. During that time he taught himself Ruby on Rails in order to build ALittleBitWeird.com, a music distribution platform that allowed fans to download free music in exchange for providing exposure on social media. Nick went on to build BidMessenger.com, a Bid Process Management solution that saves Construction Estimators 8+ hours on every bid by automating 99% of communications between Prime and Subcontractors. Eager to continue his education alongside other talented developers, he joined Def Method as a Software Engineer in August of 2017. In his free time, Nick is a singer-songwriter and also plays guitar in a math rock band.</p>

<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong></p><p>I never really made a conscious decision to work in tech, it's just that all the projects that I was interested in pursuing led me down the tech route. In high school I wanted a cool myspace, so I learned HTML/CSS. In college I wanted to run an eCommerce website/blog so I learned php/wordpress. After college I wanted to build a digital media distribution platform, so I learned Ruby on Rails. I'm motivated by my goals, and I learn whatever I need to along the way in order to accomplish them.</p>

<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> "When I was in kindergarten, we had a computer in our classroom that we could use to play educational games. One day the computer wasn't working - frozen or crashed or something. I had no idea what I was doing, but I messed with it for a few minutes and got it working again. I was so proud of myself! I think that's when I fell in love with computers.</p><p>I got into programming in high school, when I started writing simple programs on my TI-89 graphing calculator - like solving chemistry equations, that sort of thing. One day I decided I wanted to make a tic tac toe game. I really struggled with it, but a friend of mine helped me out and taught me a lot of things. In the end, we created a fully functional two-player game, though we never made an attempt at an AI. That entire process - struggling with syntax, thinking through logical complexity, ending with a working product - made me love programming and decide to study it in college."</p>

The teacher left us to attempt to learn how to program the robot on our own without guidance at initially. The first time I got the robot to simply turn left in response to an object being in front of it was the coolest feeling. I've been hooked on developing software ever since."</p>
