<p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong>"Since I was very little I wanted to be a 'scientist' of some kind. Around the time I was in Junior High, Digital Equipment Corporation moved into my town - part of the deal was that they'd donate computers to the school system. In 8th grade 'Industrial Arts' class we were shown how to use one to write a simple Basic program (it was actually a VT52 networked with the PDP-11(?)&nbsp;in the high school). Something about that dumb program got me hooked."</p>
